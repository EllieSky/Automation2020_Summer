Time passed and Mr. Green the leprechaun came back to the boy's house. The boy’s name was Leo. Mr. Green knocked on the door, and Leo ran to open the door. Mr. Green said “Hi” to Leo. Leo said “Hi. Would you like to go to the beach?” Mr. Green said “Sure, but how are we going to get there?” Leo said “In a car”. “What is a car?” asked Mr. Green. “Come here, I'm going to show you,” replied Leo. “Oh, so this black thing is a car” said Mr.Green. “Yeah.” said Leo. Leo opened the car’s doors. “Hop in,” said Leo. Mr. Green got in but he was a little scared. When Leo closed the car’s doors, Mr. Green was super, super, SUPER!!!, scared. He started yelling “Ahhhhhhh!!!!” Leo said “Calm down!” but Mr. Green didn’t calm down. Leo said “Calm down. Please.” Mr. Green said “How can I calm down, if we're locked in this car?” “We’re not locked,” said Leo, “I just closed the door’s”. “Oh sorry, I just never was in a car” said Mr. Green. “Ok,” said Leo, “let’s go to the beach!!!“ “Sure!!!” said Mr. Green. 
When Leo and Mr. Green finally arrived to the beach, Mr. Green asked, “What is that yellow crumbled thing on the ground?” Leo said “That's sand. Don’t eat it!” “Let’s build a sand castle,” said Leo. “Yay we're building a sand castle!” yelled Mr.Green. “Let’s go.” said Leo. 
Leo and Mr. Green built a gigantic sand castle. For decoration they used sea shells and sea glass. Mr. Green went into the sand castle and he said “It’s beautiful! I want to live here.” When it turned dark, Leo said “I have to go home because my mom will worry”. Mr. Green replied “I have to go home too.”




Once upon a time there was a boy named Leo. One time in March he set up some leprechaun traps to catch a leprechaun. At night he went to sleep. He was so excited that first he couldn't sleep but then he still fell asleep. The next morning he went to check every trap except the secret trap that he forgot about. Every trap was broken and there was a big mess. Then he remembered and he went to check the secret trap. He said “If leprechaun are real I think there would be one in my trap and he is the one who made a big mess in my house”. He said “WOW!!!” because he saw a leprechaun. Leo said “What is your name?” but the leprechaun didn’t answer. Leo asked again “What is your name please?” The leprechaun said “My name is Mr. Green”. Leo said “Oh hi Mr. Green!”    Mr. Green said “Do you have more gold?” Leo said “No but I have special green gold with chocolate inside”.  The leprechaun said “Green gold, what is that? I never saw green gold?” Leo gave Mr. Green a green chocolate candy and they became friends.
